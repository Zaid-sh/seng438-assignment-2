# 1 Introduction

This lab aims to generate unit test cases for the Range and DataUtilities classes provided in the JFreeChart framework. Before this lab, we had a basic understanding of black-box testing including methods such as Equivalence Class Testing, Boundary Value Testing, Robustness Testing, and Category-Partition Testing. Black box testing refers to testing a system without any knowledge of the internal structures or workings. This allows thorough testing of the input and output of the software without being biased by the code structure.

Our goal in this lab was to apply the fundamentals learned in class and apply automated unit testing using JUnit to test for the requirements of the system. We have achieved a working understanding of JUnit, implementing black box testing techniques, and using Javadoc to develop edge test cases.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed



// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The work was divided first by the moudle that was being tested, betwween Range and DataUtilities. Then we split the funtions for each module where one person would do three functions and the other would do two.
